TASK 2: BMI CALCULATOR 

This Python programming Script helps calculate a person's Body Mass Index (BMI). It's simple and user-friendly. Enter the weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) using clear prompts. The program utilises the standard BMI formula to calculate BMI scores precisely. The program also categorises BMI as Underweight, Normal weight, or Obese, offering a clearer understanding of health status. The additional feature is to get a personalised message based on the BMI category. These messages might suggest maintaining a healthy weight, losing weight, or seeking medical advice for potential health concerns. 

The Code Editor I've Used is : Google Colaboratory.
