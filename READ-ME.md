In this Python project, I have written a code that takes password security to a new level, ensuring a solid shield that protects passwords from easy guessing.
I have used the "Secret" Library; the program generates a random password and ensures that the generated values are cryptographically secure. 
The password incorporates alphabets, numbers, and symbols, creating a complex and highly secure combination. 
An additional layer of security is introduced by appending a unique identifier derived from the "uuid" Library. 
Despite the advanced security features, the program maintains a user-friendly interface Where we can Specify the desired password length.#OasisInfobyte
